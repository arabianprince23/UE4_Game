The visual part of the game simulates a tunnel in which the player is waiting for a lot of obstacles and enemies. The concept of the game is to collect coins. Collecting them becomes more difficult as the game progresses, as the running speed increases. There are also bonuses in the game that allow you to get through walls for a limited time, as well as getting double the amount of coins.

The number of levels is infinite, with each new level contributing to the character's speed. Levels are procedurally generated: platforms are continuously generated. Platforms that passed the player are removed.

Control via AWSD, or the usual arrows.
